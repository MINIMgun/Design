# MINIM Fonts

This file contains the information about which fonts and font weights I use were.

## Main Font - Raleway

The primary font I use is the [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) font by Matt McInerney, Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida. I uploaded the Version I use to this repository in case the original version gets lost at some point or what’s more likely that google shuts down Google Fonts.

### Normal Text

For standard texts I use the default font weight of 400 - regular

### Logo

For the logo or any reference where I write MINIM I use the font weight 600 - semi-bold.

## Accent Font - Permanent Marker

The second font I use is [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker) by Font Diner. I use this font mainly for subtitles or thumbnails, basically any place where there’s not a lot of text but you want to get the message across while still being entertaining.
